## Structs, part one

Structs are one of the ways Swift lets us create our own data types out of several small types. For example, you might put three strings and a Boolean together and say that represents a user in your app. Most of Swiftâ€™s types are implemented as structs, including String, Int, Bool, Array, and more.
